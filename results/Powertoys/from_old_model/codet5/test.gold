106	common : remove hwnd_data_cache ( # 1223 ) the cache was introduced to improve performance by not querying the os for the window process path every time we need to check if the window is interesting to fancyzones . since then other changes were made to the the way we check the windows . right now , the isinterestingwindow function is called when : 1 ) winkey + arrows are used 2 ) window is started to be dragged 3 ) window is created 1 ) and 2 ) are initiated by the user , happen only once per interaction so their performance impact can be dismissed . the 3 ) happens all the time but for the most part the check for ws_child or getancestor ( window , ga_root ) = = window will filter those out . in the end , only top - level windows will be queried for their path . removing the cache improves code readability and will make code maintenance easier .

317	upgrade check - spelling to 0 . 0 . 17 - alpha ( # 10173 ) * spelling : snapped signed - off - by : josh soref <jsoref @ users . noreply . github . com> * spelling : split signed - off - by : josh soref <jsoref @ users . noreply . github . com> * ci : update to spell check to 0 . 0 . 17a in the past , plurals ` foo ` + ` s ` and past tenses ` foo ` + ` ed ` were automatically tolerated . this turned out to be a bad design choice on my part . the basic example is that ` potatos ` would sometimes be treated as a mistake and sometimes not ( depending on the presence of ` potato ` ) . you can see in this pr , that this logic resulted in ` snaped ` being accepted as a word along with ` actioned ` - - there ' s nothing intrinsically wrong w / the latter , but unfortunately in order to screen out the former , my shortcut just couldn ' t stick around . this means that the ` expect ` files will grow perhaps by a tiny bit , but as you can see , not really by much . when github initially introduced github actions , the event for ` pull_request ` was created without enough permission for a tool like this to work properly . i worked around that by using the ` schedule ` event . in 2020 , they introduced a replacement event ` pull_request_target ` which has enough permission . this means that i can stop relying on the ` schedule ` event .
